# Certificates
#

#
# NOTES:
#  - The role can create its own certificate but its setup is quite simple and
#    not for production setups. It is recommended that you create the SSL
#    certificates in a different way and then copy them on the appropriate place
#    inside the ripple-solution directory structure. Then set the various _prefix
#    to the certificate names.
#  - All the certificates must be shared across members of the same cluster
#

# Prefix for certificate names. Full certificates names will be in the form of
# "<prefix>.crt" and the keys will be "<prefix>.key"
